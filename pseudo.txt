PROGRAM SmartClock:
    IMPORT REQUIRED LIBRARIES (WiFi, RTC, IMU, LED)
    LOAD SECRETS (Wi-Fi credentials)

    DEFINE CONSTANTS:
        NTP_SERVER = "pool.ntp.org"
        TIMEZONE_OFFSET = -5*3600
        BUTTON_PIN = 12

    DECLARE GLOBAL VARIABLES:
        LED matrix controller
        Display modes (TIME, TEMP, ACCEL)
        displayActive flag
        timestamps for motion/scrolling

    SETUP:
        INITIALIZE serial communication
        CONFIGURE LED matrix (brightness)
        SETUP button pin (INPUT_PULLUP)
        INITIALIZE IMU sensor
        CONNECT TO WIFI
        SYNC TIME WITH NTP SERVER

    MAIN LOOP:
        CHECK button presses (mode cycling)
        CHECK accelerometer for motion
        MANAGE display timeout (auto-dim)
        
        IF displayActive:
            SWITCH displayMode:
                CASE TIME:
                    GET current time from RTC
                    FORMAT as HH:MM
                    DISPLAY on LED matrix
                CASE TEMP:
                    READ internal temperature
                    FORMAT as X.XÂ°C
                    DISPLAY on LED matrix
                CASE ACCEL:
                    READ accelerometer data
                    MAP values to LED positions
                    DRAW moving dot visualization
        ELSE:
            CLEAR LED matrix

    FUNCTIONS:
        connectToWiFi():
            ESTABLISH connection using credentials
            RETRY until connected

        syncTime():
            FETCH epoch time from NTP
            UPDATE RTC if successful

        handleInputs():
            DEBOUNCE button
            CYCLE modes on press
            DETECT motion via accelerometer

        managePower():
            TURN OFF display after 1min inactivity
            WAKE ON motion detection
